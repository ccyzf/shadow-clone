# Shadow-Clone Algorithm README

## Introduction

The Shadow-Clone algorithm is an advanced technique designed for digital voice and video synthesis. It enables the cloning of a target's voice and generates digital human videos with lip-synced animations based on the cloned audio. This process is divided into four main steps:

1. **Audio Input and Preprocessing:** Involves the preprocessing of audio inputs and training of two specific models to achieve the corresponding voice models.
2. **Text-to-Speech Cloning:** Uses the input text to generate cloned audio through inference with the trained models.
3. **Lip-sync Video Generation:** Utilizes the cloned audio to drive lip movements in the video, resulting in a lip-synced video output.
4. **Facial Detail Enhancement:** Applies face super-resolution algorithms to enhance the details of the lip-synced video, producing a high-quality final video.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The Shadow-Clone algorithm relies on the PyTorch framework. Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed by referring to the `requirements.txt` file in this repository.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

You can execute the Shadow-Clone algorithm in two ways:

- **Batch Mode:** Run `go-clone.bat` to process an entire workflow from audio input preprocessing to final video enhancement automatically.
- **Step-by-Step Mode:** If you prefer to run specific parts of the process manually, you can execute `GPT-SoVITS/go-webui.bat` for the text-to-speech cloning part and `Wav2Lip-former/wav2lip-former.bat` for the lip-sync video generation step.

## Detailed Steps

1. **Audio Input and Preprocessing:**
   - The first step involves preparing the audio input and training models for voice cloning.
   - This step is crucial for capturing the unique characteristics of the target's voice.

2. **Text-to-Speech Cloning:**
   - Upon receiving textual input, the system generates cloned audio that mimics the target's voice through deep learning models.

3. **Lip-sync Video Generation:**
   - The cloned audio is then used to animate the lips of a digital avatar, creating a video that appears to speak the input text.

4. **Facial Detail Enhancement:**
   - Finally, the video undergoes a facial detail enhancement process to improve the quality and realism of the digital avatar.
